Different approach:
Copy entire blocks.
Upon detecting block, copy to new memory block pool.

Hmm, could directly patch like in valgrind.
My approach makes indirect jumps faster -- don't have to do translation.

What to do when new block b is discovered:
1. Allocate b' in code pool.
2. Set breakpoint at end. Upon reaching breakpoint, code will then patch the next block.

Whenever a breakpoint is reached, find next


COMPONENTS:
[ ] Block class.
[ ] Set of blocks holding original code.
