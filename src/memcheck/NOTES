Threading Notes

- Trackers are thread-local, since they need to use the tracee.
- SequencePoints are both thread-local and memcheck-global -- this is difficult.
  SequencePoints should mainly just stop execution instead of doing their own pre/post work.


Interface for threads:
1. Start thread
2.


What about futexes? Will those cause issues?
One workaround would be to only let one thread ever execute a system call

ALTERNATIVE:

----------

fork() after each sequence point

-------

In start_round(), fork process. (Be sure to register w/ patcher.)
[ ] Tracee::syscall needs to support fork, or create separate fork call.
