[~] Don't patch branches eagerly. Single-step both direct & indirect branches to determine outcome.
[ ] Separate data from code
[X] classify_inst() should return bool, not enum
[X] elimintate Block::Kind enum class
[ ] unify ptr pool and block pool to avoid 2 system calls
[X] unify patch/patch_one, since no todo list needed
[ ] command-line switch for single-stepping
[ ] check if unregistering bkpts speeds up execution
[X] use handlers in bkpt map
[X] avoid redundant SET PCs
[X] remove useless bkpt addresses in terminators
[X] Cache results from get_pc(), get_sp(), etc in Tracee?
[X] Better interface for getting/setting regs -
[ ] Make Terminator constructors accept same args.
[X] Rewrite Tracee::write (iterator version) to use buffer
[X] CallTerminator needs to check if RA already translated.
[X] Fix potential bug -- CALL/RET modifies flags
[ ] Fix duplicate flush with subclasses in Terminator
[ ] Make JmpMemTerminator more general and accept subclasses
[ ] Don't mess w/ stack -- use 'xchg rsp, [rel memcheck_stack]'
[ ] Optimize by not copying all instruction data
[X] Support multiple jmp cache slots
[ ] For-loop for large jmp cache
[ ] Precompile insturction sequences.
