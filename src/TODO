[~] Don't patch branches eagerly. Single-step both direct & indirect branches to determine outcome.
[ ] Separate data from code
[X] classify_inst() should return bool, not enum
[X] elimintate Block::Kind enum class
[ ] unify ptr pool and block pool to avoid 2 system calls
[X] unify patch/patch_one, since no todo list needed
[ ] command-line switch for single-stepping
[ ] check if unregistering bkpts speeds up execution
[X] use handlers in bkpt map
[X] avoid redundant SET PCs
[X] remove useless bkpt addresses in terminators
[ ] Cache results from get_pc(), get_sp(), etc in Tracee?
[ ] Better interface for getting/setting regs -
[ ] Make Terminator constructors accept same args.
[ ] Rewrite Tracee::write (iterator version) to use buffer
[ ] CallTerminator needs to check if RA already translated.
