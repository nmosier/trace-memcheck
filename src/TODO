[~] Don't patch branches eagerly. Single-step both direct & indirect branches to determine outcome.
[X] classify_inst() should return bool, not enum
[X] elimintate Block::Kind enum class
[ ] unify ptr pool and block pool to avoid 2 system calls
[X] unify patch/patch_one, since no todo list needed
[ ] command-line switch for single-stepping
[ ] check if unregistering bkpts speeds up execution
[X] use handlers in bkpt map
[X] avoid redundant SET PCs
[X] remove useless bkpt addresses in terminators
[X] Cache results from get_pc(), get_sp(), etc in Tracee?
[X] Better interface for getting/setting regs -
[ ] Make Terminator constructors accept same args.
[X] Rewrite Tracee::write (iterator version) to use buffer
[X] CallTerminator needs to check if RA already translated.
[X] Fix potential bug -- CALL/RET modifies flags
[X] Fix duplicate flush with subclasses in Terminator
[ ] Make JmpMemTerminator more general and accept subclasses
[X] Don't mess w/ stack -- use 'xchg rsp, [rel memcheck_stack]'
[ ] Optimize by not copying all instruction data
[X] Support multiple jmp cache slots
[ ] For-loop for large jmp cache
[X] Precompile insturction sequences.
[X] Make JmpIndTerminator not touch stack
[X] Optimize block creation -- instvec inefficient
[X] Allow instruction transformer to see instructions before riprel transformation
[ ] Allow user breakpoints
[ ] Split block-term.cc into multiple files
[ ] Optimize lambda functions
[ ] Move running logic memcheck -> patcher
[ ] Write alternative of 'writer' function that accepts rvalue reference
[ ] Improve maps
[ ] Rename Map -> PageMap
[ ] Include type of sequence point encountered (SYSCALL, LOCK, RTM, SHARED MEM ACCESS, RDTSC)
[X] Fix single-stepping + shared mem bug
[ ] Restructure singlestep loop in patch.cc
[X] Option to assert all registers equal in JCC.
[ ] rename Memcheck::{cksum -> bkpt_cksum}
[ ] Define Memcheck::cur_post_states()
[ ] Add boundary checks on all subround counter accesses.
[ ] *** Central fill location using references
[ ] Move STATIC data to class members to avoid multithreading problems
[ ] In inst.hh, use template-simulated inheritance
[ ] max_inst_len -> MAX_INST_LEN
[ ] Tracee::regs_good_ -> gpregs_good_
[ ] Check return values of all syscalls
