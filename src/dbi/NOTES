fork() Support (w/o exec)

Assume that code will NOT change, so can still use shared block cache.

Upon initialization, Patcher should set parent tracee to PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK.
Upon each stop, Patcher should check if status has PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK event. If so, it should create a new tracee and add it to the map.

TODO:
[ ] Parameterize execution policy for Patcher:
    - Sequential/blocking: run one tracee to completion before running the next -- waitpid()
    - Parallel/nonblocking: run all tracees at once -- wait()

Assume that all threads will not be stuck in indefinite loop.
